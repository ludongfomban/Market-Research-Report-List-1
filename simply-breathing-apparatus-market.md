<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Simply Breathing Apparatus Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-Circuit</li><li>Closed-Circuit</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The breathing apparatus market is categorized into two main types: open-circuit and closed-circuit systems. Open-circuit systems release exhaled air into the environment, making them suitable for short-term use, like recreational diving or firefighting. Closed-circuit systems, on the other hand, recycle exhaled air, removing carbon dioxide and adding oxygen, allowing for longer duration use in environments where air supply is limited, such as underwater or during industrial operations. Both types serve distinct needs based on application.</p></p>
