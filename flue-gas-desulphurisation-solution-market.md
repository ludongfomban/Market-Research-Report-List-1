<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flue Gas Desulphurisation Solution Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet FGD</li><li>Dry and Semi-Dry FGD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) solution market is categorized into three main types: Wet FGD, Dry FGD, and Semi-Dry FGD. </p><p>Wet FGD uses a liquid medium, typically water with reactive chemicals, to absorb sulfur dioxide (SO2), resulting in a stable byproduct. Dry FGD employs a solid sorbent, often limestone, to capture SO2 without water, producing dry waste. Semi-Dry FGD combines elements of both, using a spray or atomization technique to create a moist byproduct that can be handled more easily in certain applications.</p></p>
