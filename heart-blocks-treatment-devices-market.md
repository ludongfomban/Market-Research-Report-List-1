<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Blocks Treatment Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sinoatrial Node (SA node) Nodal Block</li><li>Atrioventricular Node (AV node) Nodal Block</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Heart block treatment devices target specific types of conduction abnormalities in the heart. Sinoatrial (SA) node block involves interruptions in the primary pacemaker's signals, leading to irregular heart rhythms, often treated with pacemakers to restore normal function. Atrioventricular (AV) node block affects the electrical signals between atria and ventricles, resulting in a slower heart rate or missed beats. AV node blocks are typically managed with devices like dual-chamber pacemakers, which maintain synchrony between atrial and ventricular contractions.</p></p>
